Wannta create fsm for defold, so. It should be like playmaker for Unity (technically)
For example, work name is DefoldMaker

So:

All available commands should be described with single line
On enter state should run all commands, attached to them
Transitions should not have callbacks, just switching states
FSM should have variables and ability to control from external space (like, entity health)
Ability to move data to JSON? What part of data can be described as data?
Is it possible to fnd online visual editor for states at least? With JSON export
FSM should be described as easy as possible

FSM we will use: https://github.com/unindented/lua-fsm/blob/master/src/fsm.lua
Think about Eva integration, since we have already a lot of ready API
Think about Tiled integrations
Think about Eva Events instead FSM, it can be more useful (if it will be as part of Eva module)

FSM shoulbe be possible to use as script, gui_script and lua module
Script and gui_script have additional commands to control entity
Split commands in separate namespaces, like dmaker.gui/go/timer/operators ?
