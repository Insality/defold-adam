+ check max stack correct (fix stack overflow)
+ add action templates
- check pass event data (how it possible, how check group of collision for example)
+- Add GetCollisionInfo, GetTriggerInfo, GetRaycastInfo?
+ add unit tests, how can I test the actions
- add docs for other instance classes
- add docs for parser, how need to form JSON doc + add meta info for visual editor
+ delay actions to actioninstance

- keep add actions

Ideas:
* Default variables for Adam FSM? Done :)



- Add FSM to running FSM. Ability to start/stop nested FSM (example - projectiles from player)
-- required for single script and FSM to control different entities
+ add final state (should be state with only instant actions. Runs on final method)
+ rename actions template -> actions
+ action.param to timer delay seconds param
+ in params, ability to use actions.value("vector", "x") instead of string of variable
+ ability to use vector.x values in any get/set param
+ add global adam event for trigger it for all instances
- game object id as fsm id in spawned instances	
- bind ID to fsm. It should correct call with delete_self and self animations
+ general variables: lifetime, go_id context,
- how to start Adam FSM from other FSM?
